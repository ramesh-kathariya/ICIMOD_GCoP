# GeoCoP Charter

## Scope
GeoCoP focuses on:
- geospatial data management and quality
- analysis and modelling practice
- cartography and communication products
- shared standards and reusable templates
- skills development and mentoring

GeoCoP is not an operational helpdesk. It complements operational GIS delivery by sharing practice and aligning across teams. [

## Core principles (ICIMOD alignment)
- **Integrity:** be honest about limitations and uncertainty; apply “do no harm”.
- **Inclusiveness:** make space for diverse voices; respect gender and diversity. 
- **Neutrality:** stay technically grounded and politically impartial.
- **Openness:** share knowledge and reusable resources, respecting restrictions.
- **Relevance:** focus on real programme needs and regional priorities.
- **Ambition:** aim for quality and adoption, not activity alone.

## Decision making
- Majority of members (70%) present.
- Decisions must be documented in meeting notes.

## Review cycle
This charter should be reviewed once a year and updated when the GeoCoP matures. [5](https://community.esri.com/t5/education-blog/stay-updated-list-of-may-2025-technical-highlights/ba-p/1620292)
