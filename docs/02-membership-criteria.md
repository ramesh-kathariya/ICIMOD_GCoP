# Membership Criteria
GeoCoP is built to increase capability across the organisation, not only among specialists.


## Who can join
- ICIMOD staff (all categories) who work with geospatial data or products.

## Membership levels
- **Core members:** contribute regularly and help maintain shared resources (experts and specialists).
- **Contributing members:** join relevant topics and share lessons learned (analysts and associates).
- **Observers/learners:** join to learn and build basics (staff with no GIS background but intend to learn).

## Required commitments (must)
- Follow the Code of Conduct.
- Respect ICIMOD’s neutrality and the diverse contexts of member countries.
- Protect sensitive information and respect data-sharing agreements.
- Use GeoCoP spaces for learning and collaboration, not marketing.

## Minimum knowledge (baseline)
You do not need to be a GIS specialist. You should have at least a basic working understanding relevant to your role, such as:
- using maps/apps for decisions, reporting, or communication
- handling spatial data with basic quality checks
- understanding CRS/scale/uncertainty at a basic level
- awareness of privacy and sensitive-location risks

If you lack this baseline, join as an Observer/Learner and commit to learning through GCoP resources and mentoring.
