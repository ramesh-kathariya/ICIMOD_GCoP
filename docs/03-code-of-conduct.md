## 1) Where this applies
This Code of Conduct applies to all GeoCoP spaces: meetings, chat channels, shared documents, shared drives, and direct messages linked to GeoCoP work.

---

## 2) Expected behaviour (how we work together)

### 2.1 Respectful and constructive engagement (**[Integrity](https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/)** · **[Inclusiveness](https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/)**)
- Treat people with respect. Critique ideas, not individuals.
- Make room for quieter voices and early-career colleagues. Do not dominate the conversation.
- Give credit for data, code, figures, and ideas. Acknowledge sources.  
- If harm occurs, fix it. **Impact matters more than intent.**

### 2.2 [Inclusion](https://www.icimod.org/resources/14) and [safeguarding](https://www.icimod.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ICIMOD_EnvironmentalAndSocialSafeguardsPolicy2020.pdf) (**[Inclusiveness](https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/))**)
- No harassment, discrimination, bullying, or sexual misconduct.
- Support a culture of respect for gender and diversity, consistent with ICIMOD’s GESI commitments. 
- Do not share others’ private information (contact details, identity info, personal messages) without explicit permission.

---

## 3) Neutrality and professional boundaries

### 3.1 Political impartiality (**[Neutrality](https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/)**)
- Keep GeoCoP discussions technically grounded and politically impartial, in line with ICIMOD’s neutral intergovernmental role.  
- If policy implications arise, discuss evidence, methods, uncertainty, and trade-offs—without partisan positioning.

---

## 4) Promotions, conflicts of interest, and transparency

### 4.1 No marketing behaviour (**[Relevance]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/** · **[Integrity]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/**)
- GeoCoP is not a marketing forum. Share tools/events only when relevant to GeoCoP work and without spamming.

### 4.2 Conflicts of interest (**[Integrity]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/**)
- Disclose conflicts of interest when recommending vendors, platforms, services, or partnerships (including if you benefit financially or professionally). 
- If you post primarily as a representative of an organisation, state that clearly in your profile/introduction.

---

## 5) [Knowledge sharing and openness (with safeguards)](https://www.icimod.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2013_ICIMOD_DataSharingPolicy.pdf)

### 5.1 Share openly where possible (**[Openness]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/**)
- Share methods, reusable templates, code snippets, and lessons learned so others can build on them.
- Prefer documentation that others can reuse (short how-to notes, annotated workflows, reproducible scripts).

### 5.2 Protect sensitive information (**[Integrity]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/**)
- Respect data-sharing agreements, licensing, and attribution. 
- Do not share restricted datasets, sensitive locations, or partner-confidential material in open GeoCoP spaces.
---

## 6) Quality and ambition in geospatial work

### 6.1 Be useful and decision-oriented (**[Relevance]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/**)
- Focus on problems that matter to ICIMOD programmes and regional priorities. Avoid “tech for tech’s sake.”

### 6.2 Aim for adoption and improvement (**[Ambition]https://www.icimod.org/strategy-2030/**)
- Prioritise quality, reproducibility, and usability so outputs can be adopted and scaled across teams and partners. 

---

## 7) Reporting and enforcement
If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, report it promptly through the GeoCoP reporting routes (see `docs/06-reporting-and-enforcement.md`). 
For serious concerns (harassment/safeguarding/fraud/data misuse), use ICIMOD’s institutional reporting and policy routes.

---

## 8) Acceptance
By joining GeoCoP channels, meetings, or shared workspaces, you confirm you have read and will follow this Code of Conduct and ICIMOD’s values-based expectations.
