# Data Ethics and “Do No Harm”

Geospatial data can expose communities, assets, and sensitive locations. Members must apply a “do no harm” approach and handle information responsibly.

## Sensitive data (must)
Treat the following as sensitive unless explicitly cleared for sharing:
- critical infrastructure locations
- community-sensitive sites
- personal data
- threatened species locations (or anything that could enable harm)

## Publishing maps (must)
Before publishing or sharing widely:
- consider risk of harm
- anonymise, generalise, or aggregate where needed
- avoid precise points when they increase risk

## Transparency (must)
- State limitations: data gaps, uncertainty, assumptions, model constraints.
- Use consistent attribution and licensing for data and code.

## Openness (should)
Share methods and reusable resources where possible, while respecting restrictions and agreements.

### *Please adhere to ICIMOD's [data sharing policy](https://www.icimod.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2013_ICIMOD_DataSharingPolicy.pdf)*.
